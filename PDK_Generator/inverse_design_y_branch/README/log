I created a class which runs the base script for the Y-Branch optimization, but I'm having some problems calling the class in the Optimization function.

I have an error that states that the object for generating the base function must be a Python function/callable, a file name or a string with a Lumerical Script.

Error fixed, first draft ready
WARNING: When running the main function (main_y_branch_generation), please be aware of an approximately 1 hour runtime and heavy RAM usage.

Completed:

-	Run optimizations to reduce insertion loss and maximize transmission for Y-Branch Design 
-	Outputs 
     - P cell of the drawn Y branch with the appropriate layering saved as a GDS (individual function written and tested, 
     will need to be integrated with layer builder)
     - S parameters as a result of an s parameter sweep, imported to Interconnect and the scripts I’ve written will run simulations 
     with accordance to wavelength (gain, transmission, reflection) and print out graphs on the command prompt of Spyder)
     
-	I’ve written code to send the s parameters as a CML component within a CML library, will be testing as soon as I obtain the CML license 

To Do:
-	Continue editing/cleaning code functions (testing the Pcell function, adding pip install for libraries, MAC/Linux Integration)
-    Using layer builder 
-	Importing optimization parameters from YAML
-	Review design intent YAML format with Lukas, coworkers
-	Integrate CML compiler, test and obtain license
-	Creating documentation for using this script (PDF, Latex)

July 8th 12:30pm

- Completed optimzation/simulation/design parameter import from YAML
- Added PIP install for different libraries 
- Other minor bug fixes
- Working fixed cell function, will need to integrate layers in SiEPIC-fab Grouse process 

To do:
- Waiting on Federico for Layer Builder scripts 
- Running scripts on UBC server (running into a couple of bugs)
- Error checking/test scripts
