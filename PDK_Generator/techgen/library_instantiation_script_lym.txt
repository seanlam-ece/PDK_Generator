This file is part of SiEPIC-Tools and {orig_techname} PDK

NOTE: After changing code, macro needs to be rerun to install new implementation.
The macro is set to "autorun" to install PCells when KLayout is run.

WARNING: This library may have nested PCells. Running this macro with a layout open
may cause it to crash. Close the layout first before running.
